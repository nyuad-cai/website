## About

## Repository Content

This repository contains:

- Eight .html files corresponding to the eight pages of the website. 
- 1 CSS file

## Overview

Html is used to create elements in pages (text, list, link, etcâ€¦). CSS is used to style those elements. For example if I create a text in html then I can fix color, alignment, font, size, etc using CSS. Javascript is used for interactivity in the website: I used JS for the mobile menu for the mobile version of the website.
